# BOS
It is a fully functional order system


This is an order system for food services..fully functional.

...i would be adding finall functionalities like reading the json file...for now it uses internal resource(i.e the value, number of items are all inside the code)


sorry if this readme is not well written, i am not too good with article.

It might seem confusing a bit...so message me to explain or you can check the older version, i still have the comments up there..

OK.. UPDATE:
i have fully made it a very functional program, the features include:

1. it can take order
2. process the order and makke the calculations
3. the administrative script is fully loaded with:
3.1 the ability to edith values in the resource in real time.
3.2 the ability to add new items to the resource file, their name, price and value
3.3 get the data stored in the resource file... 
4. the main BOS file displays items dynamically, i.e the menu items are totally based of whats in the reource file, so it give room for change whenever the administrator makes it.
5. resources can also be displayed from the main BOS  file but cannot be chnaged from there.IT IS DISPLAYED USING PANDAS LIBRARY
and some other features:..

You might not be interested in the workings but give it a try and see for yourself

**please give me credit. it took me a while to get it all together
